## News:
The dataset will be released soon.

## Introduction:
We propose the ``tune-cross-evaluation`` paradigm, which firstly performs the systematic analysis on Vision-Language Instruction Tuning (VLIT) datasets. Based on the holistic evaluation, a comprehensive dataset namely ``REVO-LION`` (REfining VisiOn-Language InstructiOn tuNing) is proposed based on public VLIT datasets. REVO-LION includes a training set, which can be adopted for developing an all-powerful VLIT model, and an evaluation set, which can serve as a stable yet convenient benchmark.
